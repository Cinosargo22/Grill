## User Story
As a person with very picky friends I need to find recipes that meet their dietary restrictions and I often struggle entertaining my guest while cooking. I need a website that can take the burden of entertaining my guest while cooking. I would like to split the hosting/ entertainment part of the evening with some wholesome trivia from Jeopardy to keep the mood light while I cook for them.
## Project Description
Our project aims to help host entertain their guest via trivia from Jeopordy ramdomly generated thru the website while at the same time feed their guest with the appropiate food allergies. Our clients will be able to pull from a library of recepies pulled from Edamaam API. Each recepie will have nutritional information for those who are on a specific diet. As well as portions and allergens for those who need it. It's double preforming aplication for multi tasking people.
